When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So often! e.g. working alone but across multiple devices, working with multiple people who are in different places. Sharing with others!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manage conflicts
    May not want to share e.g. branches that get discarded
    Similar to why use git commit and not have it autosave

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Clone - work on the repository that you take a copy of [e.g. Collaborator on proj]
	Branch - take the original repository off in a differrent direction [e.g. Testing some changes]
    Fork - copy of the original repository off in a different direction [e.g. Take the original off in a different direction]

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can work offline!
